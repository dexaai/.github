# Dexa

It *used to be* incomprehensible for a startup to challenge Google. The product was good and the tech was untouchable.

Things have changed. People want answers from the people they trust. Not 10 blue links to SEO spam, or an LLM summarization of those links. Dexa is a new kind of *re*search engine. Ask questions and get answers directly from the people you trust, with references.
